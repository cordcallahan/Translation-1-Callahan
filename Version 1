Chaos was the first god. His daughters, Night and Earth, were the mother of all men. This was the mother of death and destruction. His children were horrible monsters: Typhon, Python and Cyclopes. Typhon and Python were huge dragons and Cyclops a foolish stone worker. But their brother Uranus was the first king of the gods. He was strong and big but also wise.
